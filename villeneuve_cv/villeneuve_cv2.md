# Skills

## Field and Research

- Have used and trained others on ecological research methods, including
  transects, quadrats, water quality, species identification (highly
  proficient in rocky coast Atlantic and Caribbean), habitat
  classification, microscope and microphotography use, and general
  photography.
- Competent SCUBA diver and snorkeler. 100+ Dives in the Caribbean, Gulf
  of Maine, and tropical Pacific. PADI Rescue Diver. \~50 dives for
  scientific purposes (transect, REEF surveys, aquaculture farms). \~15
  coldwater dives (Gulf of Maine, freshwater)
- Basic molecular and bioinformatic skills, including mDNA extraction,
  isolation, amplification (PCR), sequence assembly, and alignment.
  Construction of haplotype networks to model population structure,
  which I have previously used to analyze population structure in the
  invasive tunicate <i>Didemnum vexillum</i> (undergraduate term paper).
- Comfortable boating skills in the Caribbean, Chesapeake Bay, and Gulf
  of Maine. Small craft operation (up to 28’) and basic maintenance
  experience. Trailering experience. US Boating Certified.
- Experience with animal husbandry and aquatic plumbing. System
  experience ranges from large open-water aquaculture systems to
  recirculating seawater systems to tropical reef systems.
- Trained Wilderness First Responder. Certified August 2013, recertified
  June 2018. Wilderness Medical Associates. Experience working in
  isolated field conditions (e.g. Madagascar, Bay of Fundy, Dominica).
- Advanced French reading, writing, and comprehension. CEFR level B2.

## Organizational, Analytical and Computer Skills

- Experienced with R programming for data management and frequenstist
  statistical analysis. Extensive use throughout graduate career to
  analyze data for final thesis. RMarkdown and GitHub repository
  experience. Graphing using ggplot.
- ArcGIS analysis experience and map production. \* Image analysis
  software, including Webplot digitizer, ImageJ, Tracker, and Leica
  microimaging products.
- Scientific figure alteration via Illustrator/Inkscape.
- Time management, distance learning, and collaboration applications
  usage includes Asana, Slack, Zoom, and Google Suite.
- Website and repository design in Weebly, Google Sites, Notion, and
